# Experiment 2: Mixed Train (1+2 ops), Pure Test (2 ops)
# Train: 50% 1-op, 50% 2-op (balanced by sequence length)
# Test: 100% 2-op
# No input overlap between train and test

  min_len: 1

  # Total number of examples (easily configurable!)
  train_size: 500000
  val_size: 5000  # val = test in this experiment
  val_1op_size: 1500  # How many val examples use 1-op (rest are 2-op)

  # Balancing rules:
  # - Train: Uses all available unique 1-op pairs, fills rest with 2-op
  #   (if enough 1-op exist, defaults to 50/50 split)
  # - Test/Val: 2-op + optional 1-op (controlled by val_1op_size)
  # - 1-op train: exhaustive unique (input, operation) pairs
  # - 2-op: uniformly sampled (balanced by OPERATION)
  # - Input separation: train and test use DISJOINT sets of input vectors

  train_test_split_inputs: 0.67  # 67% of input space for train, 33% for test
